# Udacity Deep Learning

This is repository for Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree


## P1 First neural newwork
- ENV : Anaconda + Jupyter notebook + python 3.5
- Using Pandas API to load and understand your data
- Understand Nerual Network like input layer, hidden layer and output layer
- Understand activate function like sigmoid, tang and reLu.
- Understand pros and cons regarding above activate function
- Understand loss function like MSE, log loss etc.
- Understand forward propagation and backward propagation
- Build your first Nerual Netword and implement forward propagation and backward propagation
- Train your Nerual Netword and play with arguments like learning rate, epoch, hidden layer nodes etc.
- Test your model and answer what do you think of your model and why

## P2 Dog Project
- Refer to Machine Learning Project 5(Same project).
